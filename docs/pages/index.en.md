# Prisma Client Rust

Here you can find everything Rust-specific for setting up and using Prisma with your Rust projects.
It is expected that you are already familiar with the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/),
as a lot of concepts are shared from them and will not be explained here.

Prisma Client Rust is not an official Prisma product, but has been [generously supported](https://twitter.com/prisma/status/1554855900124438529) as part of their FOSS Fund.
